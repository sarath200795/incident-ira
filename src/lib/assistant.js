// Sam — Incident IRA guide. Pure, rule-based insight engine over the live org
// data (no LLM): per-page onboarding tips, suggested questions, and a free-text
// answer() that reports counts/next-steps from incidents, illnesses, injuries and
// actions. Mirrors the shape HIRA's assistant exposes so the shared Assistant
// component works unchanged. askAI is a graceful no-op (no AI endpoint).
